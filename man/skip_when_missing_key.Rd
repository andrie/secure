\usage{
skip_when_missing_key(vault = NULL)
}
\arguments{

\code{vault} or \code{inst/vault} in the current directory. If a string,
looks for a secure vault in the package with that name}

This is useful to place at the top of tests that rely on access to secured
assets. Skipped tests do not generate an error in R CMD check etc, but
will print a visible notification.
